% CALCULATE_QCOLOR_FRACTIONS_IN_BLOCK calculate pixel qcolor fractions in  block 
%   [WEIGHTS PIXEL_IDS] = CALCULATE_QCOLOR_FRACTIONS_IN_BLOCK calculates the
%   fraction of pixels (WEIGHTS) and the  q-color state(previously define) 
%   of each pixel (PIXEL_IDS) in the specified block
%   
% calculate_qcolor_fractions_in_block arguments:
%   BLOCK : An array of size [block_size x block_size x  number_of_channels] that
%   contains the multi-channel  pixel intensities for a block of image
%   pixels
%   CENTROIDS - Previously identified multi-channel intensities for the
%   (centroids of) the different qcolor states. For purposes of speed,
%   these need to be reformatted to be a matrix of size 
%   [block_size x block_size x number_of_channels x
%   number_of_q_color_types]. Thus each q-color type is represented by a
%   block where each pixel is in that q-color state.
%   CUTOFF_INTENSITY - Pixel intensity level below which pixels are 
%   considered background pixels. Value of cutoff_intensity must lie 
%   between 1 and 100. Note: Intensity is calculated after scaling as
%   specified in marker_scales variable passed to the identify_block_types
%   function
%   INCLUDE_BG - a bool which determines if background pixels are used
